      "hint": "It looks like your submission didn't detect any faults in the `Test VagueIngredient` test, even though there are supposed to be five faults. This suggests that your implementation isn't correctly identifying or handling the problematic cases in the test.\n\n### Likely Issue:\nYou may have misunderstood how to handle vague or ambiguous ingredient descriptions in the recipe data. It's possible that your code isn't fully addressing edge cases where the ingredient data is incomplete, unclear, or formatted in unexpected ways.\n\n### Debugging Checklist Step: **PRECONDITIONS**\nFocus on the inputs to the part of your code that processes or validates ingredient descriptions. Specifically:\n1. What kinds of ingredient descriptions are being passed into your code? Are they vague, incomplete, or ambiguous as expected by the test?\n2. Are you correctly identifying and flagging these cases as faults?\n\n### Suggested Next Step:\nReview the test cases for `VagueIngredient` and carefully examine the input data. Look for patterns in what the test considers \"vague\" or \"faulty\" ingredient descriptions. Then, revisit the part of your code that processes these inputs and ensure it accounts for all the edge cases. You might also want to add some print statements or logging to see how your code is interpreting and handling these inputs.",
