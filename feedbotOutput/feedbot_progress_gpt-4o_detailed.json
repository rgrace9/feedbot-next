      "hint": "It looks like your submission was tested for its ability to handle vague or ambiguous ingredient descriptions, but it failed to detect any of the expected faults. This suggests that your program might not be correctly identifying or handling cases where ingredient descriptions are unclear or incomplete.\n\n### Likely Issue:\nYour implementation may not be robust enough to recognize and process vague ingredient inputs. For example, it might not be checking for cases where the ingredient lacks specific details (e.g., \"some sugar\" or \"a pinch of salt\") or where the input format deviates from what your program expects.\n\n### Why This Happens:\nWhen dealing with real-world data, inputs are often messy or ambiguous. Programs need to account for these edge cases to ensure they behave correctly. If your program assumes all inputs are perfectly formatted or overly specific, it may fail when encountering vague descriptions.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Review the Assignment Requirements:** Double-check the assignment description and any provided examples of vague ingredients. Make sure you understand what kinds of inputs your program is expected to handle.\n   \n2. **Test with Edge Cases:** Create test cases with vague or incomplete ingredient descriptions. For example, try inputs like \"some sugar,\" \"a bit of flour,\" or \"a handful of rice.\" Observe how your program processes these inputs.\n\n3. **Check Your Parsing Logic:** Look at the part of your code where you parse or interpret ingredient descriptions. Is it flexible enough to handle variations in input? Consider adding checks for incomplete or ambiguous data.\n\n4. **Think About Fault Detection:** If the assignment involves mutation testing, your program might need to detect and report when vague inputs are present. Ensure your logic includes mechanisms to flag these cases.\n\n5. **Add Debugging Output:** Temporarily add print statements or logging to see how your program processes vague inputs. This can help you identify where things might be going wrong.\n\nBy focusing on how your program handles ambiguous inputs, you can make it more robust and better aligned with the assignment's goals. Keep iterating and testing!",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"MeasuredIngredient\" class in the mutation testing assignment has not passed the tests, as indicated by the log stating \"Faults detected: 0 / 5.\" This means that your implementation did not successfully identify or handle the mutations introduced in the tests.\n\nHere are some potential issues and steps you can take to address them:\n\n1. **Understanding Mutation Testing**: Mutation testing involves making small changes (mutations) to your code to see if your tests can catch these changes. If your tests do not detect any faults (mutations), it suggests that they may not be comprehensive enough or that your implementation does not behave as expected under certain conditions.\n\n2. **Review Your Test Cases**: Check the test cases you have written for the \"MeasuredIngredient\" class. Are they covering all possible scenarios, including edge cases? Make sure you are testing not only the expected behavior but also how your class handles invalid inputs or boundary conditions.\n\n3. **Check Your Implementation Logic**: Go through your implementation of the \"MeasuredIngredient\" class. Ensure that the logic you have written correctly reflects the requirements of the assignment. Look for any assumptions you may have made that could lead to incorrect behavior.\n\n4. **Debugging with Print Statements**: If you are unsure where the issue lies, consider adding print statements or using a debugger to trace the execution of your code. This can help you understand how your class is processing inputs and where it might be failing to catch the mutations.\n\n5. **Consult the Assignment Guidelines**: Revisit the assignment instructions and any provided examples. Ensure that your implementation aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the guidelines.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the areas that need improvement in your implementation and testing strategy. Good luck, and keep iterating on your work!",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission failed because the `Unit` enum has not been implemented yet. The error message indicates that the test is running against a fallback implementation, which means that the grading system is unable to find your code for the `Unit` enum and is using a default version instead.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Implementation**: Make sure that you have created the `Unit` enum in the correct file and that it is properly defined. Review the assignment instructions to ensure you understand how the enum should be structured.\n\n2. **Review Enum Basics**: If you're unsure about how to implement an enum in Java, revisit the concepts of enums. They are a special type of class that represents a group of constants. Ensure you are familiar with how to declare an enum and its members.\n\n3. **Look for Missing Methods**: The error specifically mentions the `getAbbreviation` method. Ensure that you have implemented all required methods for the `Unit` enum, including any that may be necessary for the tests to pass.\n\n4. **Test Your Code Locally**: Before submitting, run your code locally to see if you can replicate the test conditions. This can help you identify any issues in your implementation.\n\n5. **Consult Documentation**: If you're still having trouble, consider looking at Java documentation or resources on enums to clarify any doubts you may have about their usage.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify what is missing in your implementation and make the necessary corrections. Good luck!",
