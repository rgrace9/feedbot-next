      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"Test VagueIngredient\" is not passing due to a failure in mutation testing, where no faults were detected. This suggests that your tests may not be effectively checking the behavior of the code under various conditions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **LOCATE**: The issue likely stems from the tests you wrote for the `VagueIngredient` class.\n2. **PRECONDITIONS**: Consider what inputs or states you are using in your tests. Are they comprehensive enough to cover different scenarios?\n3. **POSTCONDITIONS**: After your tests run correctly, they should identify faults in the code, indicating that your tests are sensitive to changes in the implementation.\n\n### Most Relevant Step:\nThe **PRECONDITIONS** step is most relevant here. It seems your tests may not be set up to catch potential issues or variations in the `VagueIngredient` class.\n\n### Concrete Action:\nReview the inputs and scenarios you are testing. Ensure that you are covering a wide range of possibilities, including edge cases and typical use cases. Consider what might happen if the inputs are slightly altered or if the state of the object changes. This will help you create more robust tests that can detect faults effectively.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission did not detect any faults during mutation testing for the `MeasuredIngredient` class. This suggests that your tests may not be thorough enough to catch all potential issues in the code.\n\n### Likely Issue:\nYour tests might not be covering all edge cases or scenarios where the `MeasuredIngredient` class could behave incorrectly. Mutation testing works by introducing small changes (faults) into the code to see if your tests can detect them. If no faults are detected, it often means your tests are missing important cases.\n\n### Debugging Checklist Step: **PRECONDITIONS**\nFocus on the inputs and scenarios your tests are using. Are they comprehensive enough to cover all possible ways the `MeasuredIngredient` class could fail?\n\n### Hint:\nReview the functionality of the `MeasuredIngredient` class and think about edge cases or unusual inputs that could cause it to behave incorrectly. For example:\n- Are you testing with extreme or invalid values (e.g., zero, negative numbers, very large numbers)?\n- Are you testing all possible paths through the code, including any conditional logic?\n- Are you testing interactions between different methods in the class?\n\n### Next Step:\nExpand your test cases to include edge cases and less obvious scenarios. Pay special attention to any assumptions you might be making about valid inputs or expected behavior. After adding these tests, run the mutation testing again to see if more faults are detected.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission is failing because the `Unit` enum has not been implemented yet. The error message indicates that the test is running against a fallback implementation, which means that the grading system is unable to find your code for the `Unit` enum.\n\n### Systematic Debugging Checklist:\n\n1. **LOCATE**: The error is likely coming from the `Unit` enum implementation, specifically in the `getAbbreviation` method.\n2. **PRECONDITIONS**: The test expects the `Unit` enum to be defined with specific values and behaviors, including the `getAbbreviation` method returning a non-null abbreviation for each unit.\n3. **POSTCONDITIONS**: After the `Unit` enum is correctly implemented, calling `getAbbreviation` on any unit should return a valid abbreviation.\n\n### Most Relevant Step:\nThe most relevant step here is **LOCATE**. You need to ensure that the `Unit` enum is properly defined and implemented.\n\n### Concrete Action:\nCheck your implementation of the `Unit` enum in your code. Make sure that you have defined the enum and included all necessary methods, particularly `getAbbreviation`. If you haven't started this implementation, refer to the assignment guidelines to understand what units you need to include and how the methods should behave.",
