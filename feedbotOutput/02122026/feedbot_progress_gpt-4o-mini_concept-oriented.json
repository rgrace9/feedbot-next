      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the `Test VagueIngredient` did not detect any faults, which means that your implementation might not be handling the edge cases or variations in input as expected. \n\nThe core concept you may be misunderstanding here is **mutation testing**, which involves intentionally introducing small changes (mutations) to your code to verify that your tests can catch these changes. In this case, your tests should be designed to identify specific faults in the `VagueIngredient` class.\n\nTo improve your understanding and approach, consider reviewing the specific mutations that are being tested. Check if your test cases are comprehensive enough to cover different scenarios and edge cases for the `VagueIngredient`. You might want to create additional tests that specifically target the areas where faults could occur.\n\nTry to think about what variations of input could lead to unexpected behavior in your class and ensure that your tests are set up to catch those variations. This will help you align your implementation with the expectations of mutation testing.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the `MeasuredIngredient` class did not pass the mutation testing, which means that the tests you wrote did not effectively catch the faults introduced in your code. This suggests a potential misunderstanding of how to write robust tests that can identify issues in your implementation.\n\nThe core concept here is **test coverage**—specifically, ensuring that your tests are designed to check various scenarios and edge cases of your code. If your tests are too narrow or do not cover enough of the functionality, they may not detect faults when they are introduced.\n\nTo improve your understanding and approach, consider reviewing the specific behaviors and edge cases of the `MeasuredIngredient` class. Think about what different inputs or states could lead to unexpected results. A concrete step you can take is to create additional test cases that cover a wider range of scenarios, including boundary conditions and invalid inputs. This will help ensure that your tests are more effective at catching faults in your implementation.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission failed because the `Unit` enum is not implemented. The error message indicates that the tests are running against a fallback implementation, which means that the grading system couldn't find your code for the `Unit` enum.\n\nThe core concept you might be misunderstanding here is the importance of implementing all required components of your program, especially when it comes to enums or classes that are expected to provide specific functionality. Enums are used to define a set of named constants, and in this case, it seems like your `Unit` enum is expected to have a method called `getAbbreviation()` that returns a non-null value.\n\nTo make progress, I suggest you review the assignment requirements for the `Unit` enum. Check if you have defined the enum itself and if you have implemented the necessary methods, including `getAbbreviation()`. Make sure that your implementation aligns with what the tests are expecting. This will help you understand how to properly define and implement enums in your code.",
