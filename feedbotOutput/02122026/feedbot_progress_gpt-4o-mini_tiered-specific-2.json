      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the `VagueIngredient` class did not pass the mutation testing, as indicated by the \"Faults detected: 0 / 5\" message. This suggests that your implementation may not be adequately handling certain edge cases or scenarios that the tests are designed to check.\n\n**Hint:** Review the behavior of your `VagueIngredient` class, particularly how it processes and responds to ambiguous or vague input. For example, consider testing how your class handles a scenario where the ingredient amount is specified as \"a pinch\" or \"some\" instead of a precise measurement. The expected behavior should be that your class can interpret these vague terms and provide a reasonable output or representation of the ingredient.\n\nTo make progress, try creating test cases that include these vague descriptions and ensure that your class can handle them correctly. Specifically, check how your class responds when it encounters vague quantities and whether it produces an appropriate output that reflects the ambiguity.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"MeasuredIngredient\" class has not passed the mutation testing, as indicated by the message stating \"Faults detected: 0 / 5.\" This suggests that your code is not adequately handling certain scenarios that the tests are designed to check.\n\nHere are some specific areas to review:\n\n1. **Check for Edge Cases**: Ensure that your implementation correctly handles edge cases. For example, consider what happens when the quantity of an ingredient is set to zero or a negative number. The expected behavior should be that the program either throws an error or handles these cases gracefully, depending on the requirements.\n\n2. **Review Mutations**: Mutation testing involves changing certain parts of your code to see if your tests can catch these changes. Review the mutations that might have been applied to your code. For instance, if a method is expected to return a specific value when given a certain input, ensure that your tests are robust enough to catch if that value is altered.\n\n3. **Test Different Scenarios**: Make sure you have tests that cover a variety of scenarios. For example, if you have a method that calculates the total weight of ingredients, test it with:\n   - A single ingredient with a positive weight.\n   - Multiple ingredients with varying weights.\n   - Ingredients with zero weight.\n   - Ingredients with negative weights (if applicable).\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**: For each test case, clearly define what the expected outcome should be. For instance, if you are testing the total weight calculation, the expected outcome should be the sum of all positive weights, and it should not include any negative weights or zero weights unless specified by the requirements.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you should be able to identify where your implementation may not be meeting the requirements and adjust your tests accordingly. Good luck!",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission is failing because the `Unit` enum has not been implemented yet. The error message indicates that the test is running against a fallback implementation, which means that your code is missing the necessary definitions for the `Unit` enum.\n\nTo move forward, you should focus on implementing the `Unit` enum according to the specifications provided in your assignment. Make sure to define all the required units and their abbreviations. \n\nHere’s a specific scenario to test once you have implemented the enum: \n\nTest the case where you call the `getAbbreviation()` method on a `Unit` instance, such as `Unit.MILLILITER`. The correct program should return the abbreviation for that unit, which is expected to be a non-null string. For example, if you have defined `MILLILITER` to have an abbreviation of \"mL\", then calling `getAbbreviation()` on `Unit.MILLILITER` should return \"mL\".\n\nOnce you have implemented the enum and its methods, run the tests again to see if they pass.",
