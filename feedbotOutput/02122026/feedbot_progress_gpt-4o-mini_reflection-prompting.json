      "hint": "What do you think the purpose of the `VagueIngredient` class is in your assignment? \n\nLet's think about why this error is happening. The message indicates that your tests for the `VagueIngredient` class are not detecting any faults, which suggests that they might not be effectively challenging the functionality of your code. Consider reviewing your test cases to ensure they cover a variety of scenarios, especially edge cases. Are there specific behaviors or conditions that your tests might be missing? Reflect on whether your tests are too similar or if they are not asserting the expected outcomes clearly. This could help you identify areas for improvement in your testing strategy.",

      "hint": "What do you think your `MeasuredIngredient` class is supposed to accomplish in the context of the tests? \n\nLet's think about why this error is happening. The log indicates that there are faults detected in your implementation, which suggests that your code might not be handling certain scenarios or edge cases that the tests are checking. Consider reviewing the requirements for the `MeasuredIngredient` class and the specific behaviors that the tests are designed to validate. Are there any assumptions you've made about how the class should behave that might not align with the test expectations? \n\nTake a moment to reflect on the functionality of your class and how it interacts with the tests. This could help you identify what aspects might need adjustment.",

The error message indicates that the `Unit` enum is not implemented yet, which means that the tests are trying to run against a placeholder instead of your actual code. This suggests that you may have overlooked implementing the required methods or defining the enum itself. \n\nTake a moment to review the assignment requirements for the `Unit` enum. Make sure you have defined all necessary values and methods, particularly the `getAbbreviation` method that the test is checking. Consider what specific functionality your enum should provide and how that aligns with the test cases.",
