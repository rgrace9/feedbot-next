      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"Test VagueIngredient\" is not passing the mutation testing, as indicated by the zero faults detected. This suggests that your tests may not be effectively checking the behavior of the `VagueIngredient` class under various conditions.\n\nTo improve your tests, consider the following:\n\n1. **Review the scenarios your tests cover**: Are you testing edge cases, such as when the ingredient has no quantity or when it is null? What happens when the ingredient's properties are at their minimum or maximum values?\n\n2. **Check the assertions in your tests**: Are you asserting the expected outcomes correctly? Make sure your assertions are comprehensive and cover different possible states of the `VagueIngredient`.\n\n3. **Think about the purpose of mutation testing**: It aims to ensure that your tests can catch changes or faults in the code. What would happen if you slightly altered the behavior of the `VagueIngredient`? Would your tests still pass? \n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can enhance your test coverage and effectiveness.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the `MeasuredIngredient` class has not passed the mutation testing, as indicated by the \"Faults detected: 0 / 5\" message. This suggests that your code may not be adequately handling certain scenarios or edge cases that the tests are designed to check.\n\nTo improve your submission, consider reviewing how your `MeasuredIngredient` class responds to various inputs. Specifically, think about the following questions:\n\n1. **What happens when the ingredient amount is zero or negative?** Does your code handle these cases appropriately?\n2. **How does your class behave when given invalid or unexpected data types?** Are there checks in place to ensure the data is valid before processing?\n3. **Are there any assumptions in your code that could lead to incorrect behavior under certain conditions?** \n\nBy examining these scenarios, you can identify potential weaknesses in your implementation that the mutation tests are targeting. Focus on ensuring that your class is robust against a variety of inputs and edge cases.",

      "hint": "It looks like the test is failing because the `Unit` enum or its related methods (like `getAbbreviation`) have not been implemented yet. The error indicates that the test is running against a placeholder or fallback implementation, which doesn't provide the expected behavior.\n\n### Likely Issue:\nYou may not have fully implemented the `Unit` enum or the required methods within it, such as `getAbbreviation`. The test is expecting your code to define how each unit (e.g., CUP, TABLESPOON, etc.) is represented and how its abbreviation is returned.\n\n### Hint:\n- Review the assignment instructions for the `Unit` enum. Does your implementation include all the required units and their abbreviations?\n- Specifically, check if you’ve implemented the `getAbbreviation` method. How does your code handle returning the correct abbreviation for each unit?\n- Consider: What should happen if the `Unit` is `CUP`? What abbreviation should be returned? How does your code ensure that every unit has a valid, non-null abbreviation?\n\n### Next Step:\nStart by defining the `Unit` enum with all the required units and ensure that each unit has an associated abbreviation. Then, implement the `getAbbreviation` method to return the correct abbreviation for each unit. Test your implementation locally to verify that it handles all units correctly before running the tests again.",
