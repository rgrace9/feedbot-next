This suggests that your code may not be handling edge cases or variations in input as expected. Review the requirements for the `VagueIngredient` class and ensure that your implementation accounts for different scenarios. Consider how your code could be modified to produce different outcomes based on varying inputs.",

This suggests that your tests might not be thorough enough to catch potential issues or edge cases in the implementation. Review your test cases to ensure they cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions.
