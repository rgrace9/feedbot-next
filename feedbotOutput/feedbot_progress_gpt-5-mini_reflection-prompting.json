      "hint": "What behavior do you expect your VagueIngredient tests to catch — and which code changes should make a test fail?\n\nLet's think about why this error is happening... The report says zero faults were detected, which usually means your tests never fail when the implementation is slightly changed. That typically happens when tests either don't assert meaningful results or they don't exercise the parts of the code that would change under mutation.\n\nHints to check next:\n- Look at each test: are you asserting concrete outcomes, or just calling methods without assertions? Tests must fail when logic changes.\n- Identify the branching and comparison logic inside VagueIngredient (e.g., name matching, unit handling, quantity comparisons, case sensitivity, empty/null handling). Make sure you have tests that hit both the true and false outcomes of those branches.\n- Test edge cases and negative cases, not just the happy path: different names, different units, missing fields, differing capitalization, partial name matches, and equality/hash behavior if objects are compared.\n- Ensure your tests compare meaningful properties (so a small change in logic would trigger a failure) rather than relying on incidental behavior like default toString output.\n- As a quick experiment, make a small intentional change in the implementation (e.g., flip a comparison or return a constant) and run your tests: which tests fail? That will show where your coverage is weak.\n\nTry to add or strengthen tests that would break if the implementation were slightly wrong — that’s exactly what mutation-style checks are looking for.",

      "hint": "What do you expect Unit.getAbbreviation() to return for each Unit value?\n\nLet's think about why this error is happening... The stack trace shows an UnsupportedOperationException thrown from Unit.getAbbreviation. That typically means the method still contains a placeholder stub that throws instead of returning a value. The test is calling getAbbreviation and expects a non-null abbreviation string for each enum value.\n\nCheck these things next:\n- Open your Unit.java and find the getAbbreviation method (the stack trace points to around line 89). Is it still throwing UnsupportedOperationException or otherwise unimplemented?\n- Make sure your Unit enum actually defines the expected enum values and that getAbbreviation returns a non-null string for each value (and has the exact method signature the tests expect).\n- Confirm the file is in the correct package and compiled (so the test runner is using your implementation, not a different/stubbed one).\n- Run the tests locally after implementing the method to see any further failures and iterate.\n\nTry implementing the method so it returns an appropriate abbreviation instead of throwing, then run the tests again.",
