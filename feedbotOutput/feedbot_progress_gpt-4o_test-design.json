      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"Test VagueIngredient\" is not catching any faults, which means it may not be effectively testing the functionality of the code as intended. \n\nA test that catches this issue would focus on scenarios where the ingredient descriptions are ambiguous or vague. For example, you might consider testing inputs like \"a pinch of salt\" or \"some sugar\" to see how the program handles these non-specific quantities. The expected outcome should be that the program either raises an error, provides a default value, or handles the vagueness in a defined way.\n\nThis scenario is important to test because vague ingredient descriptions can lead to confusion in recipe execution, and ensuring your program can handle such cases will improve its robustness and usability. \n\nTo move forward, review how your tests are designed to handle ambiguous inputs and consider adding cases that specifically address these types of situations.",
