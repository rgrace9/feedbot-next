      "hint": "It looks like your test for the `VagueIngredient` class did not catch any faults, which suggests that it may not be effectively validating the behavior of your code. \n\nA test that catches this issue would focus on edge cases where the `VagueIngredient` might behave unexpectedly. For example, consider testing how your class handles ambiguous quantities or units, such as \"a pinch of salt\" or \"some sugar.\" The expected outcome should be that the program can either interpret these vague measurements correctly or raise an appropriate error if they cannot be processed. \n\nThis scenario is important to test because vague ingredients are common in recipes, and ensuring your program can handle them gracefully is crucial for its robustness. Review your test cases to ensure they cover these types of inputs and verify that the expected behavior aligns with how your class is designed to handle them.",

      "hint": "It seems that your submission for the \"MeasuredIngredient\" test did not catch any faults, which indicates that your tests may not be effectively designed to identify potential issues in the code.\n\nA test that catches this issue would focus on edge cases related to the handling of measurements, such as testing with extreme values (like zero or negative quantities) or invalid units of measurement. For example, consider what happens if you input a negative amount for an ingredient or an unsupported unit. The expected behavior in these scenarios should be that the program either raises an appropriate error or handles the input gracefully, depending on the specifications.\n\nTesting these edge cases is crucial because they help ensure that your program can handle unexpected or unusual inputs without failing silently or producing incorrect results. By designing tests that specifically target these scenarios, you can improve the robustness of your code and ensure that it behaves correctly under a wider range of conditions. \n\nReview your test cases and consider adding tests that cover these edge cases to better assess the functionality of your \"MeasuredIngredient\" implementation.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission is missing the implementation for the `Unit` enum, which is why the tests are failing. The error message indicates that the tests are running against a fallback implementation instead of your code.\n\nA test that catches this issue would check if the `Unit` enum correctly returns a non-null abbreviation for each unit type. For example, you could test with a specific unit like \"CUP\" and verify that the abbreviation method returns a valid string instead of throwing an exception. This scenario is important to test because it ensures that your enum is properly defined and that each unit has the expected behavior.\n\nTo move forward, review the requirements for the `Unit` enum in your assignment and ensure that you have implemented all necessary methods, particularly the one that returns the abbreviation.",
