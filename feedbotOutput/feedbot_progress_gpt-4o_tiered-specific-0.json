      "hint": "It looks like your program did not detect any faults during the \"Test VagueIngredient\" test. This suggests that your implementation may not be handling certain edge cases or ambiguous scenarios correctly when dealing with vague or unclear ingredient descriptions.\n\n### Hint:\nReview how your program processes and interprets ingredient descriptions, especially when they are incomplete, ambiguous, or formatted in unexpected ways. Think about how your logic determines whether an ingredient is valid or not and whether it accounts for variations or unusual inputs. Try testing your program with a variety of vague or unclear ingredient examples to see if it behaves as expected.",
