      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"Test VagueIngredient\" is not passing the mutation testing, which means that your code is not effectively handling certain scenarios that the tests are designed to check. \n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Review Your Logic**: Think about how your code processes vague ingredients. Are there specific cases where your logic might not account for variations or ambiguities in ingredient descriptions? \n\n2. **Test Coverage**: Since the test detected zero faults, it suggests that your implementation may not be robust enough to handle edge cases. What happens when the input for a vague ingredient is particularly ambiguous or incomplete? \n\n3. **Mutation Testing**: This type of testing often involves making small changes to your code to see if your tests can catch them. Consider what happens if you slightly alter the expected behavior of your code. Does your implementation still produce the correct output? \n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Are there any edge cases you might have overlooked? For example, how does your code handle an empty input or a very generic ingredient description?\n\nTake some time to review these aspects of your code, and think about how you can strengthen your handling of vague ingredients to improve your test results.",
