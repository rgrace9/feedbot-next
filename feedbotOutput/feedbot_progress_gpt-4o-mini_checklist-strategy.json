      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"Test VagueIngredient\" encountered an issue related to mutation testing, where it detected zero faults out of five possible ones. This suggests that your tests may not be effectively identifying or handling the variations in the code.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **LOCATE**: The error is likely coming from the test cases you've written for the `VagueIngredient` class. \n2. **PRECONDITIONS**: Consider what inputs or states you are using to test the `VagueIngredient`. Are you covering a variety of scenarios that could lead to different outcomes?\n3. **POSTCONDITIONS**: After your tests run correctly, they should be able to identify at least some faults in the `VagueIngredient` implementation.\n\n### Most Relevant Step:\nThe **PRECONDITIONS** step is most relevant here. You need to ensure that your tests are set up to cover a wide range of inputs and edge cases.\n\n### Concrete Action:\nReview the test cases you have written for `VagueIngredient`. Make sure you are testing with different types of inputs, including edge cases that could reveal faults. Consider what variations in the input might lead to different behaviors in the code. This will help you create more robust tests that can catch faults effectively.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"MeasuredIngredient\" test encountered issues with mutation testing, resulting in zero faults detected. This indicates that your code may not be handling the test cases as expected.\n\n1. **LOCATE**: The error is likely coming from the implementation of the `MeasuredIngredient` class or its methods, particularly those that are supposed to handle the input values or perform calculations.\n\n2. **PRECONDITIONS**: Check what inputs or states are being passed to your `MeasuredIngredient` methods. Are you ensuring that the values being used are valid and meet the expected criteria for the tests?\n\n3. **POSTCONDITIONS**: After your code runs correctly, the expected behavior should be that it accurately processes the inputs and produces the correct outputs, which would allow the tests to pass.\n\n**Most Relevant Step**: The **PRECONDITIONS** step is particularly relevant here, as it focuses on the inputs and conditions leading into your code.\n\n**Concrete Action**: Review the test cases for `MeasuredIngredient` to understand what specific inputs are being used. Ensure that your implementation correctly handles these inputs and that any assumptions you made about them are valid. This will help you identify where your code might not be aligning with the test expectations.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission failed because the `Unit` enum has not been implemented yet. The error message indicates that the test is running against a fallback implementation, which means that your code is missing the necessary definitions for the `Unit` enum.\n\n### Systematic Debugging Checklist\n\n1. **LOCATE**: The error is likely coming from the `Unit` class, specifically in the `getAbbreviation` method.\n2. **PRECONDITIONS**: The test expects that the `Unit` enum is fully implemented and that it can return a non-null abbreviation for each unit.\n3. **POSTCONDITIONS**: After the `getAbbreviation` method runs correctly, it should return a valid abbreviation for the unit without throwing an exception.\n\n### Most Relevant Step\nThe most relevant step here is **LOCATE**. You need to ensure that the `Unit` enum is properly defined and that all required methods are implemented.\n\n### Concrete Action\nCheck your `Unit` enum implementation to ensure that you have defined all the necessary units and their corresponding abbreviations. Make sure that the `getAbbreviation` method is correctly implemented to return a valid abbreviation for each unit. If you haven't implemented the enum yet, start by defining the enum values and their abbreviations. \n\nThis should help you move forward with your assignment!",
