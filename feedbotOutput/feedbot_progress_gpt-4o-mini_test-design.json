      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"Test VagueIngredient\" is not catching any faults, which means your tests might not be effectively designed to identify issues in the code. \n\nA test that catches this issue would focus on scenarios where vague or ambiguous ingredient descriptions could lead to incorrect interpretations. For example, consider testing how your code handles an ingredient described as \"a pinch of salt\" versus \"a tablespoon of salt.\" You should check if the program can correctly interpret these vague measurements and produce the expected output, such as adjusting the recipe quantities accordingly.\n\nThis scenario is important to test because vague descriptions can lead to significant differences in cooking outcomes, and your tests should ensure that the program can handle such ambiguities gracefully. Review your test cases to ensure they cover a range of vague ingredient descriptions and verify that the expected behavior aligns with how these ingredients should be interpreted in a recipe context.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission for the \"MeasuredIngredient\" test did not catch any faults, which means that your tests might not be effectively validating the behavior of your code. \n\nA test that catches this issue would focus on edge cases related to the handling of ingredient measurements, such as testing how your program responds when given extreme values (like zero or negative quantities) or unexpected input types (like strings instead of numbers). \n\nFor example, consider what should happen if an ingredient is measured with a negative amount. The correct program should ideally handle this gracefully, perhaps by throwing an error or returning a specific message. Testing these scenarios is crucial because they help ensure that your program can handle a wide range of inputs and behaves as expected under unusual conditions.\n\nTo improve your tests, review the edge cases and think about how your program should respond to them. This will help you design tests that can effectively catch any faults in your implementation.",

      "hint": "It looks like your submission is missing the implementation for the `Unit` enum, which is why the test is failing with an `UnsupportedOperationException`. This typically happens when the code that is supposed to define the behavior of the `Unit` enum has not been provided.\n\nA test that catches this issue would involve checking if the `getAbbreviation` method of the `Unit` enum returns a non-null value for a specific unit type, such as \"grams\" or \"liters\". For example, if you input a unit like \"grams\", the expected behavior is that the method should return its abbreviation (e.g., \"g\"). \n\nThis scenario is important to test because it ensures that your enum is correctly defined and that each unit has a corresponding abbreviation. Without this implementation, the program cannot function as intended, and the tests will fail. \n\nTo move forward, review the requirements for the `Unit` enum and ensure that you have implemented all necessary methods and values.",
