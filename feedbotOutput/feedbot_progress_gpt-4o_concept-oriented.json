      "hint": "It looks like your submission didn't detect any faults in the `Test VagueIngredient` test, even though there are supposed to be five faults. This suggests that your code may not be handling certain edge cases or ambiguous scenarios correctly.\n\n### Likely Conceptual Gap:\nThe issue seems to be related to how your program interprets or processes \"vague\" or unclear ingredient descriptions. In programming, handling ambiguous or incomplete input often requires careful checks and logic to ensure all possible cases are accounted for. If your logic assumes inputs will always be clear or well-formed, it might miss faults when the input is intentionally vague or incomplete.\n\n### Hint:\nReview how your code processes ingredient descriptions. Are you making any assumptions about the format or clarity of the input? Think about edge cases where the input might be ambiguous (e.g., missing quantities, unclear units, or incomplete descriptions). Try adding tests or logging to see how your program behaves with such inputs. Focus on ensuring your logic can handle these cases robustly.",
